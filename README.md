# Cognitum

A small Discord bot with statistics collection and useful utility features.

## Requirements

For correct work this bot requires:

+ NodeJS v16+
+ MariaDB v10.4.7+

On the Discord side, if your bot account have more then 100 guilds (non-verified bots with lower amount of guilds will work fine):

+ Access to the guild memebers intent.
+ Access to the mesage intent.

Without these intents bot will be unable to keep track of members activity and interact with the members properly.
